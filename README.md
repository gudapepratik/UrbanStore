UrbanStore is an online shopping platform built with React and powered by Appwrite for backend services. It provides features such as user authentication, product retrieval, cart management, and order placement. The app is role-based, supporting both customer and seller functionalities. Customers can browse products and place orders, while sellers can manage products and track/cancel customer orders. The app uses Redux for state management.

## üìù Personal Note
This app is entirely built by me, including all assets such as images, posters, and the app's complete logic. While the app is functional, there is always room for improvement. I aim to make it more refined and meaningful with future updates.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to share them. Your input is invaluable to me as I continue improving the app.
